"""
The basic idea of this silly pub-sub demonstration is that the BombTimer will publish
a BombLit event after a few seconds, which causes the Bomb to then make a timed_call()
to publish an Explosion after a few more seconds, which will then immediately light the
Gasoline on fire (publishing a Fire event), which will then cause the FireAlarm to start
alarming every second.

Testing-wise, this demonstrates proper usage of the pub-sub system including the subscriptions parameter,
the direct publish/subscribe calls, the on_subscribe callback, the timed_call function, and the
sensor reading interval functionality as demonstrated by the FireAlarm's repeated alarming.
Consider this script as a really simple check to verify that the fundamental pub-sub system is working,
but NOT a comprehensive test of many edge cases!

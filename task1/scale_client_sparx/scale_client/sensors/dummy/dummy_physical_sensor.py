    A DummyPhysicalSensor is a special type of PhysicalSensor that aims to act just like a derived
    PhysicalSensor class but does not actually manage a physical sensor device.  It generates dummy
    data (useful for testing) and has a dummy DeviceDescriptor.  Currently, this doesn't do anything
    else, but you should subclass your dummy sensors from this one in order to ensure that future
    enhancements that manage a PhysicalSensor know that this class isn't actually managing a real
    physical sensing device.

    """
    This sensor gathers 'picks', which are aperiodic events indicative of a possible earthquake as evidenced by a significant increase in the shaking felt by the accelerometer the CSN client daemon monitors.  The CSN client should be running on this platform with the proper 'hacky' configuration: using a modified `/etc/hosts` file, we trick the CSN client daemon into reporting its picks to `localhost(127.0.0.1)`.  We run a stripped-down version of their server with none of the earthquake-analysis logic that receives the pick and passes it as a SensedEvent into the SCALE client for internal publishing.  In this manner, we're basically using their local event-detection algorithm completely unmodified and running that data through our IoT system.  The client daemon is available in the `csn_bin` folder at the root of this repo.

    While not truly a VirtualSensor, it does make use of periodically reading output from the virtual server.
    We did this solely for the simplicity of implementing it...

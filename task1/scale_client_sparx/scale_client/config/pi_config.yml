# This config file contains all of the sensors we've implemented and run on the Raspberry Pi SCALE client platform

Main:
    # Here we include our default MqttEventSink configuration for uploading events to an MQTT broker
    include_config_files: ["mqtt_config.yml"]

EventSinks:
    # Store events in a local MySQL database
    MySQLDatabase:
      class: "mysql_event_sink.MySQLEventSink"
      dbname: "scale_client"
      username: "scale_usr"
      password: "123456"
    # Currently not in use due to a lack of Sigfox ultra-narrowband towers near UCI,
    # this publishes events encoded into very small messages using the
    # USB-connected Sigfox adapter.  Sigfox will then send it back to our server through
    # an HTTP call, at which point we have to convert the events back to our canonical format.
    #SigfoxPublisher:
    #  class: "sigfox_event_sink.SigfoxEventSink"
    #  serialport: "/dev/ttyUSB0"

Applications:
    # Collects location information from other sources and publishes changes so that other
    # applications can tag their events with location data
    LocationManager:
      class: "location_manager.LocationManager"
    # Works in concert with the MySQLEventSink to record events and clean them up

Sensors:
    ### Physical environment sensors
    LightSensor:
      class: "environment.light_physical_sensor.LightPhysicalSensor"
      device: "light0"
      analog_port: 3
    GasSensor:
      class: "environment.gas_physical_sensor.GasPhysicalSensor"
      device: "gas0"
      analog_port: 0
    # Passive infrared detects movement of living beings
    PIRSensor:
      class: "environment.pir_physical_sensor.PirPhysicalSensor"
      device: "pir0"
      gpio_pin: 17
    TemperatureSensor:
      class: "environment.temperature_physical_sensor.TemperaturePhysicalSensor"
      device: "cel0"
    # The CSN sensor detects possible local seismic activity.  You can bump the table to set it off,
    # but continuing to do so will convince it that this is now a normal level of shaking in the environment :)
    CSNSensor:
      class: "community_seismic_network.csn_sensor.CsnSensor"
    ### These virtual sensors consume physical environmental SensedEvents and
    # produce higher-level events they detected from analyzing that data
    PIRNoMotionSensor:
      class: "event_detectors.no_motion_virtual_sensor.NoMotionVirtualSensor"
    LightFlashSensor:
      class: "event_detectors.light_flash_virtual_sensor.LightFlashVirtualSensor"
    TemperatureHighSensor:
      class: "event_detectors.temperature_high_virtual_sensor.TemperatureHighVirtualSensor"
    UnexpectedMotionSensor:
      class: "event_detectors.unexpected_motion_virtual_sensor.UnexpectedMotionVirtualSensor"
    ### Network sensors
    # A simple heartbeat to verify this client is alive
    HBSensor:
      class: "dummy.heartbeat_sensor.HeartbeatSensor"
      interval: 60
    # Ensure we have Internet access and allow the rest of the system to adapt accordingly if we don't!
    InternetAccessSensor:
      class: "network.internet_access_sensor.InternetAccessSensor"
    ### Location sensor
    # Estimate our location using our IP address since we don't have GPS
    GeoIPSensor:
      class: "location.geo_ip_sensor.GeoIpSensor"
